I'll now summarize the key points for the user:

The project planning document for Issue #320 (implementing `--phase all` feature) has been comprehensively reviewed. The overall assessment is **PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS**, with high confidence in the implementation approach.

**Key Findings:**
1. The implementation strategy (EXTEND) is correct
2. The estimated effort (16-24 hours) is realistic
3. The test strategy (UNIT_INTEGRATION) is appropriate

**Critical Areas Needing Attention:**
1. Clarify Phase 0 integration for `--phase all`
2. Define precise progress tracking mechanism
3. Specify cost limit handling
4. Enumerate all potential error scenarios
5. Design robust state persistence strategy

**Next Steps:**
I've added 8 detailed tasks to the todo list focusing on resolving the identified improvement areas. These tasks will help ensure a robust implementation of the all-phases execution feature.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the review or help you start working on the next phase of the project?
