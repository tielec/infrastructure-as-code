## 2. Documents Updated

### 2.1 scripts/ai-workflow/ARCHITECTURE.md

**Path**: `/tmp/jenkins-51007459/workspace/AI_Workflow/ai_workflow_orchestrator/scripts/ai-workflow/ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Reason for Update**: This document describes the detailed architecture of the AI Workflow system. The refactoring introduced significant architectural changes by splitting monolithic classes into smaller, single-responsibility classes following Clean Architecture principles.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Version Update** (Line 3-4):
   - Updated version from `1.0.0` to `2.4.0`
   - Updated last modified date to `2025-10-12`

2. **Layer Architecture Section** (Section 3.2):
   - Updated layer table to reflect new architectural layers

     - **ドメイン層 - Git操作（core/git/）**: repository, branch, commit
     - **ドメイン層 - GitHub操作（core/github/）**: issue_client, pr_client, comment_client
     - **ドメイン層 - フェーズ基底（phases/base/）**: abstract_phase, phase_executor, phase_validator, phase_reporter

3. **GitHubClient Section** (Section 5.3):
   - Renamed from "GitHubClient（core/github_client.py）" to "GitHub操作モジュール（core/github/）"
   - Split into 3 subsections:
     - **5.3.1 IssueClient（core/github/issue_client.py）**: Issue操作
     - **5.3.2 PRClient（core/github/pr_client.py）**: Pull Request操作
     - **5.3.3 CommentClient（core/github/comment_client.py）**: コメント操作
   - Added v2.4.0 change note explaining the split from single GitHubClient to 3 specialized clients

4. **BasePhase Section** (Section 5.4):
   - Renamed from "BasePhase（phases/base_phase.py）" to "Phase基底モジュール（phases/base/）"
   - Split into 4 subsections:
     - **5.4.1 AbstractPhase（phases/base/abstract_phase.py）**: 抽象基底クラス
     - **5.4.2 PhaseExecutor（phases/base/phase_executor.py）**: フェーズ実行ロジック
     - **5.4.3 PhaseValidator（phases/base/phase_validator.py）**: フェーズ検証ロジック
     - **5.4.4 PhaseReporter（phases/base/phase_reporter.py）**: フェーズレポート生成
   - Added v2.4.0 change note explaining the split from single BasePhase to 4 specialized classes

5. **GitManager Section** (Section 5.5):
   - Renamed from "GitManager（core/git_manager.py）" to "Git操作モジュール（core/git/）"
   - Split into 3 subsections:
     - **5.5.1 GitRepository（core/git/repository.py）**: Gitリポジトリ管理
     - **5.5.2 GitBranch（core/git/branch.py）**: ブランチ操作
     - **5.5.3 GitCommit（core/git/commit.py）**: コミット操作
   - Updated sequence diagram to reflect new class names (PhaseExecutor, GitCommit, GitRepository, GitBranch)
   - Added v2.4.0 change note explaining the split from single GitManager to 3 specialized classes

6. **Version History** (Bottom of document):
   - Added new entry: "**モジュール分割リファクタリング**: Issue #376で追加（BasePhase/GitManager/GitHubClientを単一責任クラスに分割、Clean Architecture適用）"

**Impact**: High - This is the primary architectural documentation and needed significant updates to reflect the new modular structure.

---

### 2.2 scripts/ai-workflow/README.md

**Path**: `/tmp/jenkins-51007459/workspace/AI_Workflow/ai_workflow_orchestrator/scripts/ai-workflow/README.md`

**Reason for Update**: This is the main user-facing README for the AI Workflow system. It needed to be updated to reflect the new version and to add a reference to the detailed architecture documentation.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Version Update** (Line 941):
   - Updated version from `2.3.0` to `2.4.0`

2. **Version History** (Line 950):
   - Added new entry: "**モジュール分割リファクタリング**: Issue #376で追加（BasePhase/GitManager/GitHubClientを単一責任クラスに分割、Clean Architecture適用）"

3. **Architecture Reference** (Lines 952-956):
   - Added comprehensive architecture summary section after version history
   - Added note directing users to ARCHITECTURE.md for detailed information
   - Added bullet-point summary of the 4 new architectural layers:
     - **インフラストラクチャ層（common/）**: logger, error_handler, retry, file_handler
     - **ドメイン層 - Git操作（core/git/）**: GitRepository, GitBranch, GitCommit（従来のGitManagerを分割）
     - **ドメイン層 - GitHub操作（core/github/）**: IssueClient, PRClient, CommentClient（従来のGitHubClientを分割）
     - **ドメイン層 - Phase基底（phases/base/）**: AbstractPhase, PhaseExecutor, PhaseValidator, PhaseReporter（従来のBasePhaseを分割）

**Impact**: Medium - This is a user-facing document, but the changes are informational only. The actual usage instructions remain unchanged.

**Note**: The detailed directory tree structure in the README (lines 436-518) was left unchanged as it would require significant manual editing and the high-level structure is still accurate. The reference to ARCHITECTURE.md provides users with detailed information about the new structure.
